-- Set-based rollups of the usage tables, run inside the database so no usage row
-- travels through the service: hourly_usage_summary -> daily_usage_summary, and
-- daily_usage_summary -> monthly_usage_summary. Both are idempotent: running one
-- again for the same period changes nothing unless its source rows changed.
-- Safe to run again (CREATE OR REPLACE).

-- A counter is a per-period delta a product publishes as the amount since its
-- previous publish, so it adds up over a day and a month. Every other count type is
-- a level (users, organisations, cores, MAU, API count) whose value for a period is
-- its latest reading. Keep in step with isCounterCountType in
-- internal/repository/instance_ingestion_repo.go.
