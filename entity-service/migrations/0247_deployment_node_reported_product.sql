-- What a node said it runs, kept as reported. product_version_id is the catalogue

-- without these the reported text was thrown away, so nobody could tell what an
-- unresolved node claimed to be or which catalogue entry is missing. ServiceNow emailed
-- a fixed address on every such miss; GET /instances/unresolved-products lists them
-- instead. Safe to run again.
