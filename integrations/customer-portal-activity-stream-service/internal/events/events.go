// Package events defines the wire shape of every record on the case-events
// Kafka topic. entity-service's EventPublisherService is the actual
// producer — shared by both csm-portal-backend and customer-portal's
// backend-v2, since both call the same entity-service HTTP endpoints. This
// package is the consumer-side copy used by internal/caseevents. It's kept
// in sync BY HAND with entity-service's own internal/events.Envelope,
// csm-notification-service's own copy, and the sibling
// csm-portal-activity-stream-service's copy — four independent Go modules
// with no shared import path, all of which must agree on this shape.
